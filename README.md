# SalaniLeo's frontend for Classeviva

Classeviva is one of the most used school registers in italy.

#### This was made possible by [Lioydiano](https://github.com/Lioydiano/Classeviva-Official-Endpoints)

## What's working?

- Login - ok
- User infos - ok
- Grades - ok
- Agenda - ok
- Absences - ok
- Notice board - can't download files

## To do things:

- Notices
- Grades per quadrimester - working on it
- More, but classeviva apis suck

# Classeviva

## Things I don't like:

- The frontend is non existent
- The website is made in php
- The api response seems made by people who never even tried to create a frontend (please at least add sorting endopints for grades, both for me and for the developers)
- Private apis, at least make them open source so people like me can contribute FOR FREE for a better national service

## Things I like:

- Login with CIE

# Note for anyone working at Spaggiari

In all seriousness, please make this service better, It sucks to be like me and see things in other european states be a lot better than what we have here.
Also, PLEASE if you're going to make something as used as Classeviva make it opensource for the benefit of everyone, no one will ever help to build something for free if it's not opensource. Students like me can even improve the user experience if given the right developer tools, but I almost forgot, we are in italy and we are behind at least 30 years for everything.
